				<p class="place-description">A place that I would really like to visit is Sweden. It is a very calm 
				place and quiet place where you won't hear a lot of car driving by.My 
				cousin from my mom's side lives there, and we visit there once, but that 
				was a few years ago and I have no memory of it. I only remember that 
				Sweden was very peaceful and there was barely any constant bad news like 
				how our country has it.</p>

				<p class="person-description">A person I admired was my grandma. She was always kind to me, and 
				spoiled me a lot. <span class= "important-point">She was a great person, very protective of me when I get
				 yelled at by my parents.</span> But as a grew older, she became more different.
				 She became more stubborn then she use to be and will not eat. She is 
				 currently in the hospital and is in the middle of treatment. </p>
